# Goodcabs Performance Analytics - Data Analysis & Reporting Project

## Project Overview

**Domain:** Transportation & Mobility  
**Project Title:** Performance Assessment of Goodcabs for 2024 Targets

Goodcabs, a rapidly growing cab service company in India, has made a strong impact by focusing on tier-2 cities. With a commitment to supporting local drivers and ensuring high-quality service for passengers, Goodcabs operates across ten tier-2 cities. For 2024, the company aims to drive growth and improve passenger satisfaction, with key performance targets in mind.

The management team, led by Bruce Haryali (Chief of Operations), seeks insights into Goodcabs’ performance across critical metrics, including trip volume, passenger satisfaction, repeat passenger rate, trip distribution, and the balance between new and repeat passengers. To achieve this, the data analysis task has been assigned to me, as a data analyst at Goodcabs.

This project will involve data exploration, answering key business questions, generating reports, and designing an interactive dashboard, with insights presented to the Chief of Operations.
